### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Richard Wang. I'm a full-stack web developer specializing in all things Javascript. I primarily work in web development (Node.js, React, SQL, etc.), I have experience deploying to Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, AWS, Linode, and Github Pages.

I value high-quality design, performance, UX, and believe strongly in open-source technology and the free and open internet.
